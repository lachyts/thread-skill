# thread-skill — THREAD

## Where we are

**2026-09-21 — v2.5.0: handoff docs are durable, and a pending one owns the
continuation (ADR 0017, amends 0011).** Picked up from the deferred capture
`thread-handoff-durable-lifecycle`. Part 1: `thread:handoff` always writes and
commits `<home>/docs/handoffs/<date>-<slug>.md` — `<home>` the unit directory
(project dir under `~/Projects`, workspace dir under `~/repos/workspaces`, else
the git toplevel) — never OS temp; front matter `thread`/`written`/`status`;
the consumer marks it `consumed` at pickup (paste prompt, or `thread:open`'s new
handoff-doc mode) and its close `git rm -f`s it. Part 2: close § The handoff owns
the continuation — scope test ("would the next session, working from this doc, do
it?"), refresh-don't-restate for the mid-session-then-superseded case, no
annotation, no asking; all tests on disk (one-directory `find`, awk front matter,
consumed = delete whoever marked it); legacy docs without front matter are
counted and untouched. Verified by a five-then-nine-rep close rig (controls
proposed all four candidates; every treatment rep proposed exactly the two loose
ends). Two xhigh clean-room rounds (14 + 15 findings, all dispositioned in
`docs/reviews/2026-09-21-*`); round 2 was 53% about round 1's fixes, so the chain
stopped by METHOD K27 and the rig gated the ship. Stop hook message aligned
(`session_safepoint.py`, fixtures 38/0); Codex adapter stub's OS-temp line
dropped. Manifests re-synced at 2.5.0 (they had drifted 2.4.0 / 2.3.5).

**2026-08-29 — v2.2.0: close saves autonomously; vault tasks stay gated (ADR 0011).**
Lachy called out the close menu as rubber-stamp theatre — he ticks every
memory suggestion unread, so the gate filtered nothing while the memory
estate rotted un-pruned (ops index in ALERT, global triage 65 days overdue).
Grilled six rulings (ADR 0011): the menu survives only for vault tasks;
memory/thread/knowledge auto-execute behind a four-verb save-time triage
(`ADD | UPDATE | SUPERSEDE | NOOP`, NOOP a success state) and a frontmatter
contract (`captured` / `last_confirmed` / `status: provisional|active|
superseded` / `provenance` / `permanent`). The safety moved downstream: a
weekly autonomous **memory curator** (new `~/.agents/skills/memory-curator`,
launchd Sunday 09:30, archive-first — never deletes) prunes/merges/demotes on
*observed* usage from a new daily transcript recall harvest
(`_shared/scripts/memory-recall-harvest.py`); `/memory-triage` retired.
Close's dangling doctrine pointers repaired to
`claude-base-instructions.md § Claude memory management`; project-area file
canonically `AGENTS.md`. The frontmatter contract is a cross-repo interface —
change close and the curator in lockstep.

**2026-08-18: Windows minimal footprint; 2.1.0 finally through the cache.**
The Windows machine (native Windows, user `lachl`, rarely used) requested a
Mac bootstrap that would have re-created infrastructure that already exists:
`~/.claude` is already the private `lachyts/claude-config` repo (allowlist
gitignore, daily-sweep pushed), and its `skills/` entries are Mac-absolute
symlinks whose real bodies live in `lachyts/agents-config`. Grilled twice:
first the transport got corrected, then Lachy called overkill and the scope
collapsed to the three verbs he actually uses there (next/close/orient).
Rulings: plugin + Obsidian-synced vault is the whole Windows footprint; no
personal-config transport (standalone skills and global CLAUDE.md stay
Mac-only); no workspaces clone (shared-thread/registry features degrade
deliberately; clone only when a verb complains); no Windows fork of skill
bodies (a rewrite costs more than the two-command install and drifts
forever); no machine.json indirection (all 46 hardcoded paths resolve via
`expanduser` / Git Bash `~` once the vault syncs to
`C:\Users\lachl\repos\obsidian`). `docs/windows-setup.md` written
full-system (4307eee) then slimmed to the minimal path (118ae5a). Same
session: wave-skill's local clone deleted (the archived `lachyts/wave-skill`
tombstone remains; losslessly verified first); the vault swept NTFS-legal
for Obsidian Sync to Windows (11 renames incl. `*Active* Supplement
Protocol` with 18 wikilink updates; over-length titles shortened with
original phrasing preserved in bodies); and the 08-14 ship-pending item
closed: marketplace + plugin updated 2.0.3 → 2.1.0 on the Mac (session
restart applies). Windows plugin install in flight at close.

**2026-08-14 (later) — v2.1.0: orient launches its own batches (ADR 0010).**
Lachy challenged the SEO orient's paste hand-off believing the cc-* lane had
been retired into the engine. The docs won the factual half: the lane was
never retired (ADR 0009 kept it; the 2026-08-10 mis-routings were the thing
fixed), both SEO batches genuinely fail the fit test, and "run them as
Workflows inside the parent" is impossible — subagents inherit the parent's
MCP config and can never load a different scoped profile. The residue was
real though: the repair-autonomy principle ("never hand him commands to
type") generalises, and the tooling gap ADR 0003 was written against had
closed — `cmux workspace create --cwd … --command` delivers programmatic
scoped-session launch. Two grilled rulings: (1) orient launches batches
itself via cmux with the *expanded* profile alias (emission survives only as
the no-cmux fallback); (2) the steering answer alone authorises — no
per-batch confirm, accepted knowing batches run
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` unreviewed. Live-proven same-day: the SEO
p4/p5 batches fired as cmux workspaces 38/39, prompts verified
in-transcript. Orient §7 rewritten (write + stamp + launch + verify +
fallback), Don'ts gained the no-in-session-Workflow rule, glossary "Dispatch
artefact" updated, memory generalised. **2.1.0 is committed but not yet
shipped through the cache** — needs push → marketplace update → plugin
update → session restart (same dance as ever).

**2026-08-14 — v2.0.3: the review loop has a memory.** The Ralph-loop audit's
review-loop gap closed hands-on (grilled via plan mode, not the self-rollout
the capture's Launch block sketched): the review loop now accumulates
feedback like the plan loop, but with review semantics — the reviser gets the
latest round as its work order plus earlier rounds as ANTI-REGRESSION
constraints (fixes already committed on the branch must not regress), and the
judge gets the same history plus an anti-goalpost discipline (new objections
must come from new commits; round-1-visible nitpicks don't reject). After 2
rejections the round-3+ reviser upgrades to a **step-back round**: licence to
restructure, deviating from the approved plan where the accumulated feedback
demands it — deviations always declared (grilled decision: brief is contract,
plan is reference). Both ceiling outcomes now persist: `approvedAtCeiling`
appends the grouped history under `## Review history (approved at ceiling)`
(the p6-2 auditability gap), and `## Review-blocked feedback` upgrades from
final-round bullets to the full grouped history (legacy results fall back).
`STEP_BACK_AFTER = 2` is an engine constant, deliberately not rollout config
(EFFORT-matrix stance). Glossary gained accumulated feedback / step-back
round / ceiling approval. No ADR — prompt shapes are cheap to reverse.
Remaining from the audit: `thread-schedule-package-init-fileset-blindness` —
run it as a one-task self-rollout from a FRESH session (the version-keyed
cache means only a restart loads 2.0.3): the first live exercise of the
review-loop memory.

**2026-08-13 — v2.0.2 shipped; the merged plugin is live-proven.** The
giflab-rollout-2026-08-12 ran end-to-end on thread 2.0.x — the first
orient-originated rollout ever to reach the engine: 6/6 PRs merged
(giflab #64–#69), one designed gate pause (spend sign-off, amended live via
grill: cap $10→$50, subscription-CLI Claude arms), zero escalations/blocks.
2.0.2 = execute+gather description trims for the skill-listing budget (see
Known quirks); paired with user-settings `skillListingBudgetFraction: 0.02`.
Post-rollout Ralph-loop audit found the review loop has no cross-round
memory (plan loop accumulates feedback; review loop hands revisers only the
latest rejection) and no re-plan lever — three-fix task filed:
vault `thread-execute-review-loop-memory` (scheduled 2026-08-14), plus
`thread-schedule-package-init-fileset-blindness` from the wave-2
`__init__.py` merge-conflict incident. Both are wave-shaped; a two-task
self-rollout is the natural vehicle.

**2026-08-12 — v2.0.1: handoff becomes model-invocable.** Grilled same day as
the merge: the `disable-model-invocation: true` flag on handoff was inherited
from the flat-skill Pocock port (build-plan said "keeps", no rationale ever
recorded), and the asymmetry was backwards — close auto-commits two repos and
is visible; handoff writes only a temp file and was the one hidden route.
Flag dropped; description + body now gate on explicit fork intent or router
dispatch, with a hard no-proactive rule (context-feels-long → recommend
`next`, never self-fire). Decided: visible/explicit-intent over
visible/proactive and keep-hidden. No ADR — one-line reversible flag, stance
recorded here + CONTEXT.md § Handoff.

**2026-08-12 — v2.0.0: thread absorbs wave (ADR 0009).** The wave plugin
(`lachyts/wave-skill`, v1.4.1) merged in with full git history; all six
rollout verbs renamed `/wave:*` → `/thread:*`; "wave" is now a glossary
object, not a namespace (`wave:` frontmatter, `WAVE-STATUS:`, engine
internals unchanged). Behavioural changes from the same grill interview:
the execution-fit test got one canonical home
(`skills/_shared/execution-fit.md`) and decides the lane HARD (orient never
offers cc-* batches for wave-shaped clusters — closes the 08-10
GifLab/Smart Slider leak); schedule's <3-task floor is gone (shape decides,
not count — one-task rollouts are valid); the session-lane fallback names
its owners (defer / open's ## Launch). Wave ADRs renumbered 0004–0008;
wave's THREAD.md preserved at docs/wave-THREAD-archive.md; wave-skill
pinned at wave--v1.4.1 and archived. Live rollout notes (protocol_version:
3, incl. the open giflab-rollout-2026-08-12) remain executable unchanged.

Previous state: v1.0.1 built AND installed 2026-07-14 (`thread@thread`, user scope, GitHub
marketplace from `lachyts/thread-skill`). All six members live; flat skills
retired; workspace references migrated; vault project note [[Thread Skill]]
created. Same-day follow-up: Notion retired ecosystem-wide — close's
cross-machine-handoff destination deleted; plugin + Codex adapter +
workspaces instruction surfaces swept; shipped as 1.0.1 (session restart
applies it). Remaining: the live end-to-end verification checklist (fresh
session) — tracked by the vault task `thread-plugin-live-verification`,
scheduled 2026-07-15.

## What's been built / decided

- Plugin scaffold mirroring wave: manifests, CONTEXT.md, docs/adr/, README.
- Decisions live in `docs/adr/` — read the directory, never a remembered
  subset. ADR 0001 (the task is the floor; the thread is the upgrade) and
  ADR 0002 (`next` is a sibling, not a parent) shaped this scaffold; 0009
  (thread absorbs wave), 0010 (orient launches its own batches) and 0011
  (close saves autonomously) govern current behaviour.
- Canonical THREAD-template.md home: `~/.agents/skills/thread/THREAD-template.md`
  (harness-neutral; `check-agent-parity.py` pins it).
- Pickup auto-completes the capture task (decided in design interview).
- Stash surfacing: `/weekly` "Stashed threads" pass (decided in design interview).
- Codex `.agents/skills/{thread,close}` adapters kept as their audit-era
  **native translations** (not thinned to pointers as the plan suggested) —
  undoing deliberate Codex-safety work wasn't worth the dedup; only
  `handoff`'s canonical pointer was repointed at this repo.
- Vault project note `Work/Projects/AI/Thread Skill.md` is the
  human-facing surface (goal, terminology, wave-sibling framing); its
  `repos:` frontmatter auto-routes tasks captured from this repo's CWD.
- Build lineage: `docs/build-plan.md` (the approved plan, copied in at close).
- Notion handoff destination deleted from close (2026-07-14), not re-routed:
  Notion is a read-only legacy archive (personal → Obsidian migration
  pending); THREAD.md, git-committed by the close flow, is the cold-pickup
  artifact — a Notion page duplicated that guarantee.

## Open questions / decisions pending

- Does `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` expand in the Stop-hook command under the
  native-Windows hook runner? The first Windows session end answers it; if it
  fails, the fix lands in `hooks/hooks.json` here, never a local patch.
- Windows install verification pending: marketplace add (gh auth), first
  `/thread:next` (vault path resolution), Stop-hook noise (python3 shim is
  the optional quieting fix).

## Known quirks (don't re-derive)

- Colon namespace (`thread:defer`) requires plugin packaging; skill frontmatter
  carries the bare `name:` and Claude Code composes the prefix.
- `disable-model-invocation: true` hides a skill from the model's list but
  keeps the `/slash` form. No skill here carries it any more (handoff dropped
  it at 2.0.1); `skills/execute/SKILL.md` warns against ever adding one.
- `AskUserQuestion` requires ≥2 options per question — a close destination
  section with a single candidate can't be its own menu question; merge
  single-candidate sections into one combined multiSelect.
- A plugin installed **mid-session** hot-registers member *names* into the
  running session's skill list, but descriptions only index at session start —
  members render bare (`thread:close`) until a fresh session. Files were
  verified well-formed; don't debug this again.
- NotchBar's AgentStatus (Bartender) rewrites the direct `~/.codex/hooks.json`
  on its own schedule, injecting notify handlers tagged
  `# notchbar-agents-codex-hook` into every event (including a `Stop`) and
  flipping `features.codex_hooks` in the direct config only.
  `check-agent-parity.py` treats both as app-managed (carve-out added
  2026-08-12, same precedent as its `node_repl` fields). Codex `hooks.state`
  `trusted_hash` values are Codex-internal — they match no derivable
  serialisation of the hook; never hand-author trust entries.
- **Skill-listing budget silently drops descriptions.** Claude Code caps the
  model-facing skill listing at `skillListingBudgetFraction` (default 0.01 =
  1% of context) with a 1536-char per-description cap; over budget, whole
  descriptions vanish and skills render as bare names — killing their
  natural-language triggering (7 of 13 thread skills were bare pre-fix).
  User settings carry `0.02` since 2026-08-13; keep SKILL.md descriptions
  ~600–700 chars (2.0.2 trimmed execute+gather; `schedule` is the next trim
  candidate). Files can be perfectly valid YAML and still render bare —
  check the budget before debugging frontmatter.
- **Vault filenames must stay NTFS-legal** (no `? * : " < > |`, no trailing
  space/dot, basenames within MAX_PATH) or Obsidian Sync silently refuses
  them on Windows. Capture titles become filenames, so task-writer is a
  producer of this risk (sanitisation task proposed and declined 2026-08-18;
  vault swept clean same day, link-safety verified before each rename).
- Skills execute from `~/.claude/plugins/cache/thread/thread/<version>/`, not
  the `marketplaces/thread/` clone — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to the
  cache path. The cache is **version-keyed**: `claude plugin marketplace
  update thread` alone only refreshes the clone and never rebuilds the cache.
  Full update flow: bump the version in BOTH `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → push → `claude plugin marketplace update
  thread` → `claude plugin update thread@thread` → restart the session to
  apply (verified 2026-07-14 shipping 1.0.1).

## Resume instructions

1. Read this file, then `CONTEXT.md` and the ADRs in `docs/adr/` — the whole
   directory, not a subset. The rollout lane, orient's self-launching and
   close's autonomy each rest on an ADR added after v1.0.0.
2. `skills/_shared/task-writer.md` is the single source for task shape —
   never change task behaviour in a route skill directly.
3. Automated checks are `README.md` § Tests. A live end-to-end checklist is
   written from the current specs — `task-writer.md` § 3b (a `defer` is not
   done until the target day note carries its `## To do` line; the TaskNotes
   agenda is secondary discovery) plus each route's SKILL.md.
   `docs/build-plan.md` § Verification is the historical v1.0.0 checklist: it
   predates § 3b and passes a defer that writes only `scheduled:`. Don't
   route live testing through it.

## Session log

- 2026-09-21: 2.5.0 — durable handoff lifecycle in `thread:handoff` (docs/handoffs, never temp; pending→consumed→deleted) + close's handoff-owns-the-continuation rule (ADR 0017 amends 0011); `thread:open` handoff-doc pickup; two xhigh rounds consumed, K27 stop, rig-gated; hook + Codex stub aligned; manifests 2.5.0. Ship pending: push → marketplace update → plugin update → restart.
- 2026-09-01: 2.3.1 — phantom-gate footnote fix (ADR 0013): parseGatedInputs reads only list items ("- "/"* "/"+ "/numbered), prose in "### Gated inputs" is commentary; a section with no items and no "None" fails closed to plan-blocked (self-healing re-plan, same door as missing); planner/judge/reviser prompts hardened to bullets-only. Live trigger: chorus-rollout wave 2's planner footnote paused a fully signed-off task at gate-pending. Prompt bytes changed — in-flight resume caches re-run (clean, not corrupt). Shipped through the cache; restart applies.
- 2026-08-31: 2.2.1 — docs-only patch shipping the 2026-08-30 doc-audit remediation through the cache (0ee53f6): repair's model-facing description now matches the ADR 0009 glossary (engine, not wave, holds merge authority); THREAD.md resume instructions point at all of docs/adr/; build-plan.md stamped historical.
- 2026-08-29: 2.2.0 — close de-gated (ADR 0011): menu only for vault tasks; four-verb save-time triage + provisional/provenance frontmatter; weekly memory-curator system + daily recall harvest built on the workspaces side; /memory-triage retired; doctrine pointers repaired; ">4 sections" dead prose deleted (open-question nit resolved). Curator dry-run clean (byte-identical restore) → 7 spec fixes; inaugural live launchd run OK (archived 1 · merged 2 · demoted 3 · 47 index lines repaired; decay correctly gated by legacy grace) after one exit-127 fix (launchd PATH omits ~/.local/bin — runner resolves CLAUDE_BIN). 2.2.0 shipped through the cache; restart applies.
- 2026-08-18: Windows scope grilled down to a next/close/orient minimal footprint (plugin + synced vault; personal-config transport killed; no workspaces clone; no fork; no machine.json); docs/windows-setup.md added then slimmed; wave-skill local clone deleted (archived tombstone kept); vault NTFS-filename sweep (11 renames, 18 wikilinks updated); 2.1.0 shipped through the cache (restart applies); Windows install in flight.
- 2026-08-14 (later): 2.1.0 — orient self-launches its batches via `cmux workspace create` (ADR 0010: steering answer = sole authorisation, emission = no-cmux fallback); rulings grilled off the SEO orient paste-hand-off challenge; live-proven by firing the SEO p4/p5 batches (workspaces 38/39); wave-repair-autonomy memory generalised. Ship pending: cache dance + restart.
- 2026-08-14: 2.0.3 shipped — review-loop memory (accumulated feedback with anti-regression framing, anti-goalpost judge discipline, step-back round at 2 rejections, ceiling outcomes persisted to the note); grilled 4 design forks via grill-with-docs; all suites green; capture task done.
- 2026-08-13: 2.0.1 (handoff visible, intent-gated) + 2.0.2 (description trims) shipped; skill-listing budget discovered + bumped to 0.02; giflab rollout landed 6/6 through the merged plugin (first orient→engine loop); Ralph-loop audit → review-loop-memory + package-init-blindness tasks filed.
- 2026-08-12 (merge-day follow-up): merge-day parity follow-up — the 4 reported checker errors (plus 10 same-day drift) diagnosed to NotchBar's Codex hook injection + hardlink/mode drift; checker gained the NotchBar app-managed carve-out, add.md fan-out re-linked, PASS restored. Follow-up: [[notchbar-codex-hooks-follow-up]].
- 2026-07-14: Notion retired ecosystem-wide — handoff destination deleted from close, workspaces + Codex adapter swept, migration task + global memory captured, v1.0.1 shipped (found: plugin cache is version-keyed).
- 2026-07-14 (later): installed as thread@thread + references migrated + vault project note; first live close ran from the plugin itself; verification task scheduled for 2026-07-15.
- 2026-07-14: thread created — v1.0.0 built end-to-end from approved plan.
